This site was created for our Genius Hour project in the semester 2 SCH4UE-C chemistry class, taught by Mr. Williams. As group 2, we decided to investigate **candle materials and compositions** and their effects on **candle properties**.

Group 2 is composed of:
- Kevin Huang
- Simon Wu
- Nathan May
- Daniel Sun

On this site, you'll find blog posts and pages documenting our research and experimentation process throughout the project.
