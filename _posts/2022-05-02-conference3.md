# Genius Hour – Conference 3
Group 2: Simon Wu, Kevin Huang, Nathan May, Daniel Sun | May 2nd, 2022

Link to website (currently work-in-progress): <https://company-of-candle-savants.github.io/>

## Project plan
Our project plan consists of purchasing and making candles of several different types of wax, and testing various
properties of them, in order to link our research into how candle materials affect candle properties with experimental
results.

## Annotated bibliography – Updated
### Chemistry of the Christmas Candle — Part 1
Roth, K. Chemistry of the Christmas Candle — Part 1. ChemViews 2011. <https://doi.org/10.1002/chemv.201000133>.

#### Summary
A journal article on the composition of candle waxes through the years. Waxes come in many different forms, often made
up of mixes of fatty acids, long esters and hydrocarbons. Beeswax, for example, was commonly used for high-quality
candles, and is made up mostly of long-chain acids, esters and hydrocarbons. Stearin, made up almost entirely of
long-chain acids (stearic acid) was later synthesized, and is still occasionally used. But nowadays, candle-making is
dominated almost entirely by paraffin waxes – mixes of long-chain saturated hydrocarbons usually derived from slack wax,
a product of petroleum refinement.

### Candle composition – US20080307696A1
WU, B.; WAI, D. Y. K.; HUEN, J. C. S. Candle Composition. US20080307696A1, December 18, 2008.
<https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080307696A1/en>.

#### Summary
This is a patent we found on the solidification of oils (mixtures of shorter-chain fatty acids, mostly) using paraffin
wax (long-chain hydrocarbons). It discusses the use of many different kinds of oils, such as mineral oils, olive oil,
palm oil, canola oil and some less common fats and other substances. The wax that results from the procedures in the
patent usually has a lower melting point than the pure paraffin (often around 10℃ lower).

### Everything You Need To Know About Candle Wax
Elizabeth. (2020, February 1). Everything You Need To Know About Candle Wax. <https://www.osmology.co/blog/which-wax/>

#### Summary
This is a blog post that goes over many different types of candle waxes, such as beeswax and paraffin. It also includes
a lot of information on more modern types of wax, such as those made of rapeseed oil or soybean oil. It includes
information on comparisons between these waxes, and attributes, such as certain types of volatile emissions from
paraffin waxes.

### Candle wax blends - Can you mix paraffin and soy wax?
Gimik, S. (2020, October 11). Candle wax blends—Can you mix paraffin and soy wax?
<https://downhomewicks.com/candle-wax-blends-can-you-mix-paraffin-and-soy-wax/>

Summary
This one is a blog post on different types of wax blends, and the attributes that these wax blends have when producing
candles from that wax. For example, soft waxes such as soy wax can be blended with paraffin wax to make the wax more
firm and improve its surface quality. Beeswax, on the other hand, is very firm, and can be mixed with soy wax to prevent
cracking and brittleness.
