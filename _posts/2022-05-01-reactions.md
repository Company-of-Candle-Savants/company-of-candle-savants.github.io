Both complete and incomplete combustion takes place. These reactions are responsible for producing the light in the
candle. Incomplete combustion can produce volatile compounds that can be potentially hazardous.

The wax that undergoes incomplete combustion is reponsible for the yellow glow of the flame. The wax is heated to the
point of incandescence, which provides light.

In the blue zone of the flame, wax undergoes complete combustion. Due to the energy released, electrons are excited,
then fall to their ground state. They release photons which produce the blue light.
