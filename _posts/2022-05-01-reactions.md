What kind of reactions take place in a candle?
Obviously, the most prominent reaction that takes place is the combustion reaction that produces the 'flame' of the
candle. Both complete and incomplete combustion takes place, producing different types of light, and occuring in
different regions of the flame.

Complete combustion occurs in two areas of the flame. At the base of the flame there is a blue coloured oxygen rich
area. Electrons are excited, then fall to their ground state, which releases photons responsible for the blue colour.
The other area where complete combustion occurs is at the 'edge' of the flame that comes in direct contact with oxygen.
This area also has a blue colour due to the excitation of electrons but is very faint because the layer is very thin.

Incomplete combustion occurs in the inner areas of the flame, as oxygen cannot easily penetrate the outer layer into
these regions. The carbon particles in this region of the flame are heated to incandescence, giving off yellow light.
The particles in this region are heated so much that they break apart into smaller compounds (the term for this is
pyrolysis), which can be volatile. These incompletely combusted carbon particles is what we see as soot or smoke.

Candles and Chemical Kinetics
A candle uses combustion reactions to produce light, this reaction must be controlled for safety. It can be potentially
hazardous if the reaction produces too much energy. Luckily, candle wax is made of longer hydrocarbons, which are more
difficult to ignite compared to shorter hydrocarbons. This is because longer hydrocarbons have more chemical bonds and
therefore have a higher activation energy.

So how is the reacction controlled? Molten wax near the flame of the candle is drawn up by the wick through capillary
action. As the wax gets closer to the flame, it is vaporized and can then be ignited. The amount of wax drawn up can be
controlled by adding/decreasing woven filaments to the wick. By controlling the amount of fuel given to the flame, the
combustion reaction can be controlled.
