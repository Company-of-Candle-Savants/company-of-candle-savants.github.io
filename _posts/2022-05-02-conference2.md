## Chemistry of the Christmas Candle — Part 1

### Summary
A journal article on the composition of candle waxes through the years. Waxes come in many different forms, often made
up of mixes of fatty acids, long esters and hydrocarbons. Beeswax, for example, was commonly used for high-quality
candles, and is made up mostly of long-chain acids, esters and hydrocarbons. Stearin, made up almost entirely of
long-chain acids (stearic acid) was later synthesized, and is still occasionally used. But nowadays, candle-making is
dominated almost entirely by paraffin waxes – mixes of long-chain saturated hydrocarbons usually derived from slack wax,
a product of petroleum refinement.

### Summary
This is a patent we found on the solidification of oils (mixtures of shorter-chain fatty acids, mostly) using paraffin
wax (long-chain hydrocarbons). It discusses the use of many different kinds of oils, such as mineral oils, olive oil,
palm oil, canola oil and some less common fats and other substances. The wax that results from the procedures in the
patent usually has a lower melting point than the pure paraffin (often around 10℃ lower).

## Things we’ve learned about
Firstly, it seems that over time, candle compositions have shifted away from fatty-acid and ester-based waxes to
mixtures containing much more paraffin (long-chain saturated hydrocarbons), likely because it’s very easy to manufacture
and acquire, coming from a byproduct of oil refinement. Perhaps 95% of candles manufactured nowadays are paraffin-based,
with the rest split between beeswax and stearin. It also seems that interest is increasing in alternative candle
formulations more closely matching naturally-occuring waxes (see patent above), for various reasons.
