The materials of a candle provide the fuel needed for the combustion reaction that produces light. The materials used
affects the chemical reactions that occurs during combustion, and physical properties of the candle.

## History
### In this section we give a brief overview of materials historically used in candles

#### Beeswax
- Composed of a mixture of various long-chain alkanes, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and esters
- The esters found in beeswax provide a pleasant fragrance, which is attractive
- Beeswax burns well, however is too expensive for common use

#### Animal Fats
- Cheaper than beeswax and more commonly used
- Inferior material, often smelled and was sooty
- Mainly composed of triglycerides: a combination of triglycerol (alcohol) and long-chain fatty acids
- Spermaceti was a material obtained by the whaling industry, and is mostly composed of esters

#### Stearin
- First semi-synthetic wax
- Created by saponification of lard (making it into soap) followed by acidification
- Softening point close to its melting point, so it retained its shape even in warm rooms

#### Paraffin
- By-product produced during refinement of oils and natural gas
- Very cheap, making it popular in modern day
- Composed mostly of long-chain alkanes

#### Mineral Oil
- Material formed through solidification of shorter chain oils and paraffin
- Has a lower melting/softening point than paraffin

## Properties
Long-chain organic compounds are very non-polar. The main intermolecular attractions are london-dispersion forces. Since
these compounds tend to be straight-chain and very long, these attractions are very strong. These attractions are
responsible for determining the melting/softening point of the candle.

Various organic compounds have different properties due to their functional groups. For example, the esters in beeswax
have a pleasant fragrance. Mineral oil aims to combine paraffin with shorter-chain organic compounds, which can add
various fragances and properties to the material.

The organic compounds in the candle wax undergo a combustion reaction which produces light. Long-chain organic compounds
do not burn as well as short-chain organic compounds. Additionally, the activation energy of the reaction is much
higher than short-chain organic compounds. This is because long-chain organic compounds have a lot of chemical bonds,
which must first be broken in order to react.

Both complete and incomplete combustion occurs in the flame of the candle. Due to convection, there is a lack of oxygen
in some parts of the flame. Due to the heat (pyrolysis), the long-chain organic compounds are split into several smaller
organic compounds. This creates the 'soot' we see when a candle burns. These compounds can be volatile and potentially
dangerous.
