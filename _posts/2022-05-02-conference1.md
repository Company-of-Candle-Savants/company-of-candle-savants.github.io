# Genius Hour – Conference 1
Group 1 – Simon Wu, Kevin Huang, Nathan May, Daniel Sun

### Genius Hour:
A system started at google where 20% of work hours are devoted to a side project outside of normal work hours. Employees
would get full rights over their work, and if Google thought that the work was interesting then they would offer to buy
the rights off of them. Examples of these products are Google mail, adsense, and Google news. The system is successful
because employees can choose what they work on, so the quality of work is increased because of their passion. In
addition, there is no pressure to complete the product by some deadline.

### Fertilizer
- How are different fertilizers made?
- How does compost compare to industrial processes?
- What are the effects of manufacturing on the environment?
- What are the different effects of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous fertilizers?
- How does the chemical composition of fertilizers enable them to be used by plants?

### Candle Composition
Comparison of materials: how does traditional materials (beeswax, stearin) compare to modern materials (paraffin)?
- Energy released when burnt (enthalpy of reaction)
- Brightness
- emissions (carbon dioxide)
- Health effects?
- Fire Safety

How do different hydrocarbon mixtures affect the melting point of the candle?
- wax solidification (short chain + long chain mixture), structure
- branching vs straight chain
