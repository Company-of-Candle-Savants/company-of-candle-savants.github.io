In order for us to test the physical properties of different mixtures of waxes and other hydrocarbons, we first have to create the hardened waxes/candles to test with.

We ended up making 4 different mixtures to test with.

## Mineral Oil

This candle mixture is derived from a way to solidify different oils into a solid wax.

It consists of 70% mineral oil, 25% paraffin wax, and 5% microcrystalline wax.

## Butyl Sterate

This candle mixture is also derived from a way to solidify different oils into a solid wax. Except this uses a different oil, Butyl Sterate, rather than Mineral Oil.

It consists of 70% butyl sterate, 25% paraffin wax, and 5% microcrystalline wax.

## Beeswax and NatureWax C-1

NatureWax C-1 is an all natural industrial wax blend designed for candles with a make-up mostly consisting of soy wax and palm wax. We used this wax along with beeswax to produce a candle wax with much greater stiffness compared to the solidified mineral oils.

It consists of 90% NatureWax C-1 and 10% beeswax.

## Everything

This was a fun candle that we decided to make that combined all of the waxes that we had together.
