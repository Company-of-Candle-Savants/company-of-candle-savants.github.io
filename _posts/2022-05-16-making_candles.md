In order for us to test the physical properties of different mixtures of waxes and other hydrocarbons, we first have to
create the hardened waxes/candles to test with. We ended up making 4 different mixtures to test with.

## Mineral Oil

At room temperature, the mineral oil was a clear, colourless liquid mixture of various different hydrocarbons. However,
we were able to solidify the mixture by adding some paraffin wax into the mixture. The long-chain hydrocarbons in
paraffin wax have stronger london dispersion forces, allowing it to bind together the shorter hydrocarbons.
It consists of 70% mineral oil, 25% paraffin wax, and 5% microcrystalline wax.

Compared to the C1 candle, which was the hardest, adding in mineral oil made the mixture softer. We found that dropping
a 33.5g weight made an indenture to a depth of 10 mm, compared to the 1 mm depth when dropped on the C1 mixture. We also
found that it deformed slightly when touched, taking on fingerprints easily.
In our soot test, we found that the candle burnt the second most sootiest. However, the soot was not so significant that
it can be noticed while the candle was burning, and the evaluation of "soot" is qualitative.

## Butyl Stearate

Butyl stearate was also liquid at room temperature, however it was made of a single type of hydrocarbon instead of a
mixture. We solidified butyl stearate the same way: by adding in paraffin wax.
It consists of 70% butyl sterate, 25% paraffin wax, and 5% microcrystalline wax.

Although similar in composition to the mineral oil we found that this mixture was slightly harder. The 33.5g weight made
an indenture to a depth of 6mm, compared to 10mm for the mineral oil. Like the mineral oil, the candle was soft enough
to easily fingerprint. Interestingly, although similar to the mineral oil mixture, the candle burnt exceedingly well,
with almost no soot at all, rivalling the C1 mixture. There was little to no soot present in our soot test. This mixture
burnt with similar brightness to the mineral oil mixture..

## Beeswax and NatureWax C-1

NatureWax C-1 is an all natural industrial wax blend designed for candles with a make-up mostly consisting of soy wax
and palm wax. We used this wax along with beeswax to produce a candle wax with much greater stiffness compared to the
solidified mineral oils.
It consists of 90% NatureWax C-1 and 10% beeswax.

As both beeswax and C1 was solid at room temperature, it was unsurprising that this candle was the hardest candle we
created. However, we still found that slight marks could be found by touching the candle. The 33.5g weight made an
indenture to a depth of 1mm, surpassing all the other candles. We also found that the candle burnt exceedingly well,
with little to no soot. This mixture burnt the most dim out of the mixtures, having the smallest flame.

## Everything

This was a fun candle that we decided to make that combined all of the waxes that we had together. This candle we made
ended up being softest among the candles we made. In our drop test the weight pierced through until it was stopped by
the rim of the candle, making an indenture the depth of 21mm. The mixture can be easily deformed, having a consistency
similar to vaseline. We found that this mixture burnt the most sootiest out of all our mixtures, however this soot was
difficult to notice by eye. We also found that this mixture burnt the brightest, producing the largest flame.

The candle-making process was quite simple. We first measured our ingredients and melted them down on a hotplate. After
waiting for the mixture to cool a little, we proceeded to pour the mixture into jars. The container we used had to be
quickly wiped down before the leftover wax solidified, as it is difficult to wash wax. After that we left our wax
candles to solidify on a flat surface so the candle did not deform.

Cleanup is difficult as wax is not water-soluble, so we had to be careful not to spill any material.
