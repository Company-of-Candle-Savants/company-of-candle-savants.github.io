A candle uses combustion reactions to produce light. However, this reaction must be controlled for safety. If too much
wax is burned, a fire may be started. If too little, the flame may extinguish. The mechanism that controls the reaction
rate in a candle is the wick.

The wick draws up molten wax near the flame through capillary action. This controls the amount of reactants available to
the chemical reaction. The amount of wax drawn up can be controlled by adding/decreasing the number of woven filaments
in the wick.
